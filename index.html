                My name is Ebenezer Cobbinah with the Index of <b>[0721000116]</B> but i'm almostly knowns as <b>"0xide"</b>. I've been fascinated by science and technology since childhood. I love to know the inner workings of any electronic device I use. As I got older, my interest in technology and programming grew stronger. I aspire to be a research scientist for machine learning algorithms.
                
                Machine learning algorithms are methods that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. They are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, speech recognition like Google Assistant or Siri for IOS users, agriculture, and computer visionÂ². There are four types of machine learning algorithms: transformers, supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement. 
                
                I am particularly interested in Large Language Model(LLM), which is a type of machine learning that involves learning from trial and error based on feedback from the tons of text data from all sources like chat <i>forums, Academic Papers, Text books, Ancient text</i>. Reinforcement learning algorithms can achieve complex goals and adapt to changing situations. Some examples of reinforcement learning applications are self-driving cars, game-playing agents, and robotics.
                
                I want to pursue a career in research and development of reinforcement learning algorithms that can solve real-world problems and improve human lives. I believe that machine learning is one of the most exciting and impactful fields of science and technology today, and I want to be a research engineer tackling fundamental principle of computing, Using altificial Intelligence (deep neural network) to design computer chip through an evolution algorithms technique to improve performance and efficiency in modern RISC and CISC based
