              <p>“I had the pleasure of teaching [Ebenezer Cobbinah] several courses, including Data Structures, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence. Cobbinah was an outstanding student who demonstrated a keen interest and aptitude for computer science. Ebenezer always completed the assignments on time, asked insightful questions, and participated actively in class discussions. Cobbinah also impressed me with [his/her/their] final project, which involved developing a chatbot using natural language processing techniques. Cobbinah is a talented and motivated computer scientist who will excel in any academic or professional setting.
